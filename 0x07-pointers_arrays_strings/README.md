In its most basic description, a pointer is a memory address. Nothing else to it! I promised you pointers are not scary, didnâ€™t I ðŸ˜‰.

Of course, that is not technical enough for us. Allow me to clarify what exactly I mean by memory addresses.

Computers store digital information in the form of bits and bytes, with one byte representing the equivalent of eight bits, and one bit representing two possible values - true (1) or false (0). Memory is tracked using what is referred to as addressing, the designation of bytes with numerical values; most commonly, addresses are represented in hexadecimal values.
